# MapplsGeofenceUI Plugin for iOS

## [Introduction](#Introduction)
Mappls Geofence Plugin SDK provides the functionalities to create a geofence in circle and polygon shape.

## [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)

Anyone can integrate the Mappls Geofence Plugin by following simple steps.Please note that this Plugin for iOS supports iOS SDK 9.0 and above. 

To integrate Geofence SDK, it is important to pass an object of **MapplsMapView** which is part of Mappls's MapplsMap SDK.

## Step 1 :-  [Setup your Project](#Setup-your-Project)

1. To start with,  MapplsAPIKit and MapplsMap frameworks are required to be added in your project. These are available on Cocoapods and it can be accessed by using below pod commands.

    ```cocoapods
    pod 'MapplsGeofenceUI'
    ```

    **Note:** Mappls's SDK keys will required to initialize MapplsMap SDK. 
    
    Fore more information on setting Click [here](https://github.com/mappls-api/mappls-ios-sdk/).
    user can get the keys by login/signup on Mappls's developer [Dashboard](https://about.mappls.com/api/signup).

    **Below are commands to install SDK using Cocoapods:**

    - `cd Your Project path`
    - `pod init`
    - `pod install`
    - `open your xcworkspace`

### [Version History](#Version-History)

| Version | Dated | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `1.0.0` | 10 June, 2022 | Initial Mappls Release |

## Step 2 :-  [Authorization](#Authorization)

### [MapplsAPICore](#MapplsAPICore)
It is required to set Mappls keys to use any MAPPL's SDK. Please refer the documentatation [here](MapplsAPICore.md).

## Step 3 :-  [Initialization of GeofenceViewUI](#Initialization)

To Initialize, add **MapplsGeofenceUI** and **MapplsMap Framework** in your controller File.

```swift
import MapplsMap
import MapplsGeofenceUI
var geofenceView: MapplsGeofenceView!
 override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
  // If you're on a background thread and want to execute code on the main thread, you need to call async()
 DispatchQueue.main.async {
let geofenceInstance: MapplsGeofenceView =  {
geofenceView = MapplsGeofenceView.init(geofenceframe: self.view.bounds)
geofenceView?.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]
 return geofenceView
}()
geofenceInstance.delegate = self
self.view.addSubview(geofenceInstance)
}
}
``` 

User must implement the **MapplsGeofenceViewDelegate** protocol class to use delegate methods of MapplsGeofenceView

```
 geofenceInstance.delegate = self
 ```

**Thats All!** The plugin is added in your application.

30. **Circle Proposed Radius :** It is the dotted line draw around a circle when user moves the slider value. Code to use this feature is as follows :

    ```swift
    @IBAction func btnSliderValueChanged(_ sender: UISlider, forEvent event: UIEvent) {
            
      if let touchEvent = event.allTouches?.first {
        switch touchEvent.phase {
          case .began:
          print("Slider Began")
          break
        // handling the drag began
          case .moved:
          print("Slider Moved")
          
          geofenceView.circleProposedRadius = Double(sender.value)

          break
          // handling the drag moved
        case .ended:
        print("Slider Ended") 

          geofenceView.circleRadius = Double(sender.value)

        break

    geofenceView.setCircleCenterCoordinate(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.7041, longitude: 77.1025))
    ```

32. **Geofence Polygon Drawing Enabled :** To  enable or disable the polygon drawing board.

    **Note:** *While using Polygon Mode and using setMode functions, it resets property `isPolygonDrawingEnabled` to true. Value of this property must be considered on receiving callback using delegate method geofenceShapeDidChanged.*

    ```swift
    geofenceView.isPolygonDrawingEnabled = true
    ```

33. **Polygon Drawing Stroke Width :** To set the width of stroke of drawing board while creating polygon geofence. Default value is 2.

    ```swift
    geofenceView.polygonDrawingStorkeWidth = 2
    ```

34. **Polygon Drawing Stroke Color :** To set the color of stroke of drawing board while creating polygon geofence.

    ```swift
    geofenceView.polygonDrawingStrokeColor = UIColor.gray
    ```

35. **Change Polygon's Mid Marker Image :** To change image of marker in the middle of polygon edge lines.

    ```swift
    geofenceView.midMarkerViewImage = UIImage(named: "pinMid")
    ```

36. **Change Polygon's Creation Mode :** Polygon can be created either by free hand drawing on a drawing overlay or by simply tapping on the map. 

    As suggested by name itself, it is property is used change mode of creating polygon.Default to `draw`.

    **Note:** *On setting its value to `tap`, value of `isPolygonDrawingEnabled` will be changed to false automatically.*

    ```swift
    geofenceView.polygonCreationMode = .tap
    ```
    
37. **Auto Hide Edge Markers :** Control points of polygon while dragging are visible by default so the value remains false. To hide them, user can set below property to true.

    ```swift
    geofenceView.isHiddenPolygonControlPoints = true
    ```

38. **MapplsGeofenceViewDelegate :** It is a protocol class which will be used for callback methods as shown below:

    **1. Call Back Handler :** Geofence's Shape object can be queried by using this protocol.
    Geofence shape data will return in following case.

    - When CircleSlider Value Changed.
    - When circle centre points changed.
    - When set radius changed.
    - When free hand drawing finished.
    - When polygon point dragging finished.
    - When any polygon point to move and Delete.
    - When Geofence Circle did end dragging. 

    ```swift
    geofenceShapeDidChanged(_ shape: MapplsGeofenceShape)
    ```

     **2. Mode Callback :** It basically returns your current mode like circle or polygon

    ```swift
    geofenceModeChanged (mode: MapplsOverlayShapeGeometryType)
    ```

    **3. Circle Radius Changed :** To  get circle radius changed value in this delegate method.

    ```swift
    circleRadiusChanged(radius: Double) 
    ```
    **3. Circle Radius Changed :** To get if circle did end dragging.

    ```swift
    didDragGeofence(isdragged: Bool)
    ```

39. **Custom Marker on Geofence View :** 
For adding custom marker on geofence view, we have created one class in sample `Custom geofence annotation`. This class is inherited with `MGLPointAnnotation` and  `GeofenceAnnotation`.

    Basically **geofence Annotation** is protocol class that contain annotation image. User can set image by using this property  `geofenceAnnotationImage`.

    **Note** *- To help more, we are showing one marker on the top right corner in the sample app (ClassCustomGeofenceVC)*.


     To Check this, Refer to the code below after creating Polygon Click marker button:

    ```swift
    // Use this class to test marker on map.
    let annotation = CustomGeofenceAnnotation()
    annotation.title = ""
    annotation.coordinate = coordinate
    if let image = UIImage(named: "pin.png") {
    annotation.geofenceAnnotationImage = image
    } 
    geofenceView.mapView.addAnnotation(annotation)
    ```

41. **Polygon Center as Coordinate :** 
We have added property and method to get polygon center as Coordinates.
Below code refers one  Class function and another as global property to get the Polygon Center as coordinate.

    ```swift
    let center = geofenceView.polygonCenterCoordinate
    print(center)
    let location = MapplsGeofenceView.centerCoordinateOf(coordinates: polygonPints, mapView: geofenceView.mapView)
    print(location)
    ```

42. **Rectangle Polygon:**
To draw a rectangle-shaped polygon, mode must be set to polygon, polygonCreationMode property must be set to be tap, isPolygonDrawingEnabled property must be set to false and isRectangleShapeSelected must be set to true. See below code snippet 

    ```swift
    geofenceView.polygonCreationMode = .tap
    geofenceView.setMode(mode: .polygon)
    geofenceView.isPolygonDrawingEnabled = false
    geofenceView.isRectangleShapeSelected = true
    ```

# Sample App

In the Sample **Version 0.5.0**, we have added some more functionalities like:

#### **1. Polygon points Check (Anticlockwise or Clockwise)**
To  see if the polygon points are drawn clockwise or antoclockwise, draw polygon points in sampleApp. We have one button that shows direction in top right corner of custom geofence class.

#### **2. Draw Geofence Shape View**
To  view your geofence created shape by clicking on Apply button(In customGeofenceVC Class). When the user clicks on Apply button, it will navigate to related list in  class(DrawCircleVC).

#### **3. Edit Geofence Shape**
In Class (DrawCircle) we are showing one option to edit on click. 
It will navigate to the related geofence screen with current shape, here, user can modified it.

After clicking Apply button, it will reflect in (DrawCircleVCClass).

#### **4. Delete Geofence Shape**
We have provided a delete button in (rawCircleVC Class). Clicking on this, will delete the current shape in the list.
