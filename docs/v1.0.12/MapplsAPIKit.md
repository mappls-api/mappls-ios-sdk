## [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)

Mappls Map SDK for iOS lets you easily add Mappls Map and services to your own iOS app.It supports iOS SDK 9.0 and above and Xcode 10.1 or later. You can have a look at the map and features you will get in your own app by using the Mappls Map app for iOS. The SDK handles Map Display along with a bunch of controls and native gestures.

## [Authorization](#Authorization)

### [MapplsAPICore](#MapplsAPICore)
It is required to set Mappls keys and authenticate before using any Mappls SDK. Please see the reference [here](MapplsAPICore.md).

## [API Usage and Requirements](#API-Usage-and-Requirements)

The allowed SDK hits are described on the plans page. Note that your usage is shared between platforms, so the API hits you make from a web application, Android app or an iOS app all add up to your allowed daily limit.

## [Autosuggest API](#Autosuggest-API)

Get "type as you go" suggestion while searching for a location.

The Autosuggest API helps users to complete queries faster by adding intelligent search capabilities to your web or mobile app. This API returns a list of results as well as suggested queries as the user types in the search field.

For live demo click [LIVE DEMO](https://about.mappls.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/sample/mapmyindia-maps-auto-suggest-api-example.php)

The Autosuggest helps users to complete queries faster by adding intelligent search capabilities to your iOS mobile app. It takes a human readable query such as place name, address or Mappls Pin and returns a list of results.

Class used for Autosuggest search is `MapplsAutoSuggestManager`. Create a `MapplsAutoSuggestManager` object using your rest key or alternatively, you can place your rest key in the `MapplsRestKey` key of your application's Info.plist file, then use the shared instance of `MapplsAutoSuggestManager` class.

To perform auto suggest use `MapplsAutoSearchAtlasOptions` class to pass query parameter to get auto suggest search with an option to pass region in parameter `withRegion`, which is an enum of type `MapplsRegionType`. If no value is passed for region, It will take default value which is India.

`MapplsRegionType` is used to validate and get result for different countries availble with Mappls [200+ countries & territories](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-rest-api/blob/master/docs/countryISO.md)

Additionally you can also set location and restriction filters in object of `MapplsAutoSearchAtlasOptions`. 

### Request Parameters

1.  **location:**  Location is required to get location bias autosuggest results.
2.  **zoom:**  takes the zoom level of the current scope of the map (min: 4, max: 18).
3.  **includeTokenizeAddress**: On setting value of this property to true it provides the different address attributes in a structured object in response.
4.  **pod**: It takes place type which helps in restricting the results to certain chosen type  
    Below mentioned are the codes for the pod -
    -   Sublocality
    -   Locality
    -   City
    -   Village
    -   Subdistrict
    -   District
    -   State
    -   Subsublocality
5.  **filter**: This helps you restrict the result either by mentioning a bounded area or to certain Mappls Pin. Below mentioned are both types whose instance can be set to this parameter -
    -   (a) `MapplsMapplsPinFilter`: to filter results on basis of Mappls Pin.
    -   (b) `MapplsBoundsFilter`: to filter results on basis of geo bound. It accepts a value of type `MapplsRectangularRegion`.
6. **hyperLocal**: This parameter lets the search give results that are hyper-localized to the reference location passed in the location parameter. This means that nearby results are given a higher ranking than results far from the reference location. Highly prominent results will still appear in the search results, however they will be lower in the list of results. This parameter will work ONLY in conjunction with the location parameter.
7.  **isBridgeEnabled:**  To get suggested searches in response. Value must be set `true` of this.

8. **responseLanguage:** It is of type `string` it is use to get the response in specified language.

### Response Parameters

In response of auto suggest search either you will receive an error or an object of `MapplsAutoSuggestLocationResults`(derived from `MapplsLocationResults`) which contains an array of `MapplsAtlasSuggestion` (derived from `MapplsSuggestion`) and an array of suggested searches of type `MapplsSearchPrediction`.

***Note:*** As class of response object will be derived from `MapplsLocationResults`, You will need to cast it into `MapplsAutoSuggestLocationResults`.

You will find below useful properties in suggestion object :

1.  **type:**  type of location POI or Country or City
2.  **mapplsPin:**  Mappls Pin of the location 6-char alphanumeric.
3.  **placeAddress:**  Address of the location.

Get most accurate lat long combination for a given address

All mapping APIs that are used in mobile or web apps need some geo-position coordinates to refer to any given point on the map. Our Geocoding API converts real addresses into these geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) to be placed on a map, be it for any street, area, postal code, POI or a house number etc.

Class used for geocode is `MapplsAtlasGeocodeManager`. To create instance of `MapplsAtlasGeocodeManager` initialize using your rest key, clientId, clientSecret , grantType **or** use shared instance of `MapplsAtlasGeocodeManager` after setting key values `MapplsRestKey`, `MapplsAtlasClientId`, `MapplsAtlasClientSecret`, `MapplsAtlasGrantType` in your application’s `Info.plist` file.

To perform geocode use `getGeocodeResults` method of instance of `MapplsAtlasGeocodeManager` class which accepts an instance of  `MapplsAtlasGeocodeOptions` class. To create instance of `MapplsAtlasGeocodeOptions`, pass any address as query parameters to geocode.

### Request Parameters

1. **`query`**: The address of a location (e.g. 237 Okhla Phase-III).

Additionally you can also set some other parameters in object of `MapplsAtlasGeocodeOptions` to get some specific results. Which are:  

2. **`maximumResultCount`**: The number of results which needs to be return in response.

### Response Parameters

In response of `geocode` search either you will receive an error or an array of `MapplsGeocodedPlacemark`. Yo will find below useful properties in suggestion object :

1. `houseNumber`: The house number of the location.
2. `houseName`: The name of the location.
3. `poi`: The name of the POI if the location is a place of interest (POI).
4. `street`: The name of the street of the location.

## [Routing API](#Routing-API)

For live demo click [LIVE DEMO](https://about.mappls.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/sample/mapmyindia-maps-route-adv-api-example)

Get optimal & alternate routes between various locations with or without considering live traffic

Routing and displaying driving directions on map, including instructions for navigation, distance to destination, traffic etc. are few of the most important parts of developing a map based application. This REST API calculates driving routes between specified locations including via points based on route type(optimal or shortest) and includes delays for traffic congestion.

Use `Directions` to get route between locations. You can use it either by creating object using your rest key **or** use shared instance of `Directions` class by setting rest key in the `MapplsRestKey` key of your application’s `Info.plist` file.

#### Swift
```swift
let directions = Directions.shared
```

#### Objective-C
```objc
MapplsDirections *directions = [MapplsDirections sharedDirections];
```

To perform this operation use object of `RouteOptions` class as request to pass source location and destination locations and other parameters.

### Request Parameters

To use **Route with traffic based ETA** feature, to get duration inclusive of traffic for a distance between locations use parameter resourceIdentifier as described below:

- `resourceIdentifier:` This property is type of enum `MapplsDirectionsResourceIdentifier` with acceptable values `routeAdv`, `routeETA` and `routeTraffic`. The default value of this property is `routeAdv`.

To choose **Travelling Mode** use parameter profileIdentifier as described below:

- `profileIdentifier:` This property is type of enum `MapplsDirectionsProfileIdentifier` with acceptable values `driving`, `biking`, `walking` and `trucking`. The default value of this property is `driving`.

**Additionally** you can set some more parameters on instance of `RouteOptions` to get filtered/specific results as :

1. `routeType`: It is type of enum  `MapplsRouteType` which can accept values `quickest`, `shortest`, `none`. By default its value is `none`.
2. `region`: It is type of enum `MapplsRegionType`. It is used to validate and get result for different countries. Currently five countries are supported including India which are Sri Lanka, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal.
3. `instructions`: it is of type `boolean` its default value is `false`

**Note**: If you are using **Routing with traffic** `routeType` and `region` values are not considered. Traffic is only available in India and only optimal route calculation is allowed with traffic.

### Steps to get directions

- To get directions create an array of `Waypoint` class, add two objects of `Waypoint` class to this array to get route path. For origin position also set heading of instance of `Waypoint` class.
- Next create an instance of `RouteOptions` class by passing waypoints created in previous step.
```swift
let options = RouteOptions(waypoints: [Waypoint(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551078, longitude: 77.268968), name: "Mappls"), Waypoint(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.565065, longitude: 77.234193), name: "Moolchand")])
```
- Use `Directions` singleton class from `Directions` framework to get available routes.
- You can plot polylines on map for available routes by using Map framework. 

### [Directions Using Mappls Pins](#Directions-Using-MapplsPins)

An object of Waypoint can be created using coordinate as well as [Mappls Pin](#https://about.mappls.com/app/features/mapplspin/) (unique identifier of place).

```swift
Waypoint(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551078, longitude: 77.268968), name: "Mappls")

or

Waypoint(mapplsPin: "MMI000", name: "Mappls")
```

## [Congestion Delays](#Congestion-Delays)

To get congestion delays for a route, a helper function `getCongestionDelays` added in class of MapplsDirectionUtility.

**`getCongestionDelays`**

**Parameters:**
- route: An instance of 'Route'.
- fromLocation: Location coordinate from which congestion is to be calculate on a route. The coordinate should lie on line of coordinates of route.
- uptoDistane: Distance in meters, upto which congestion is to be calculate on a route
- minCongestionDelay: Minimum delay in minutes, greater than that only congestion will be returned. This value should be greated then or equal to 1.

**Returns:**
Will return an array of `CongestionDelayInfo` which contains delay in seconds and center coordinate.

**Swift**

```swift
let congestionDelays = MapplsDirectionsUtility().getCongestionDelays(forRoute: route, fromLocation: currentLocation, uptoDistane: 50, minCongestionDelay: 5)
```
