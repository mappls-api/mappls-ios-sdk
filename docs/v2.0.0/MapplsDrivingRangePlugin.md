# MapplsDrivingRangePlugin for iOS

## [Introduction](#Introduction)

The MapplsDrivingRangePlugin allows you to plot driving range area to drive based on time or distance on Mappls's vector map component.

The plugin offers the following basic functionalities:

- Get and Plot driving range as polygon on map.

- Update driving range on map.

- Clear already plotted driving range on map.

**This can be done by following simple steps.**

**Step 1:-**
## [Installation](#Installation)

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL 

```

#### [Dependencies](#Dependencies)

This library depends upon several Mappls's own libraries. All dependent libraries will be automatically installed using CocoaPods.

Below are list of dependcies which are required to run this SDK:

- [MapplsAPIKit](MapplsAPIKit.md)
- [MapplsMap](MapplsMap.md)

### [Authorization](#Authorization)

#### [MapplsAPICore](#MapplsAPICore)
It is required to set Mappls keys to use any MAPPL's SDK. Please refer the documenatation [here](MapplsAPICore.md).

**Step 2:-**
## [Plugin Initialization](#Plugin-Initialization)

### [MapplsDrivingRangePlugin](#MapplsDrivingRangePlugin)

`MapplsDrivingRange` is the main class which is need to initialize to use different functionality of plugin. It requires an instance of MapplsMapView.

It allows you to plot driving range area to drive based on time or distance.

```swift
var drivingRangePlugin = MapplsDrivingRange(mapView: self.mapView)

self.drivingRangePlugin.delegate = self // optional
```

**Step 3:-**
## [Get And Plot Driving Range](#Get-And-Plot-Driving-Range)

A function `getAndPlotDrivingRange` of instance of `MapplsDrivingRange` will be used to get driving range and plot on map. This function will accept an instance of `MapplsDrivingRangeOptions` as request to get driving range.

Below is code for reference:

```swift
let location = CLLocation(latitude: 28.551060, longitude: 77.268989)
        
let contours = [MapplsDrivingRangeContours(value: 2)]
let rangeInfo = MapplsDrivingRangeRangeTypeInfo(rangeType: .distance, contours: contours)
        
let drivingRangeOptions = MapplsDrivingRangeOptions(location: location, rangeTypeInfo: rangeInfo)
        
self.drivingRangePlugin.getAndPlotDrivingRange(options: drivingRangeOptions)
```

## [Additional Features](#Additional-Features)

### [Clear Driving Range](#Clear-Driving-Range)

Plotted driving range on Map can be removed by calling function `clearDrivingRangeFromMap`.

Below is line of code to use it:

```swift
drivingRangePlugin.clearDrivingRangeFromMap()
```

### [Update Driving Range](#Update-Driving-Range)

Plotted driving range on map can be upated by calling function `getAndPlotDrivingRange` again with new request object (instance of MapplsDrivingRangeOptions).

Below is some code for reference:

```swift
let location = CLLocation(latitude: 28.612972, longitude: 77.233529)
        
let contours = [MapplsDrivingRangeContour(value: 15)]
let rangeInfo = MapplsDrivingRangeRangeTypeInfo(rangeType: .time, contours: contours)
        
let speedInfo = MapplsDrivingRangeOptimalSpeed()
        
let drivingRangeOptions = MapplsDrivingRangeOptions(location: location, rangeTypeInfo: rangeInfo, speedTypeInfo: speedInfo)
        
self.drivingRangePlugin.getAndPlotDrivingRange(options: drivingRangeOptions)
```

## [Reference](#Reference)

### [MapplsDrivingRangeDelegate](#MapplsDrivingRangeDelegate)

It is a protocol class which provides different callbacks of events of `MapplsDrivingRange`.

Below are different callback functions avaialble:

#### [drivingRange(_:didFailToGetAndPlotDrivingRange:)](#drivingRange(_:didFailToGetAndPlotDrivingRange:))

Called when the plugin fails to get and plot driving range.

**DECLARATION**

```swift
optional func drivingRange(_ plugin: MapplsDrivingRange, didFailToGetAndPlotDrivingRange error: Error)
```

**PARAMETERS**

- **plugin:-** The plugin that has calculated a driving range.

- **error:-** An error raised during the process of obtaining a new route.


#### [drivingRangeDidSuccessToGetAndPlotDrivingRange(_:)](#drivingRangeDidSuccessToGetAndPlotDrivingRange(_:))

Called when the plugin succeed to get and plot driving range on map.

**DECLARATION**

```
@objc optional func drivingRangeDidSuccessToGetAndPlotDrivingRange(_ plugin: MapplsDrivingRange)
```

**PARAMETERS**

- **plugin:-** The plugin that has calculated a driving range.
