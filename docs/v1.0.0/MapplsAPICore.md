# [MapplsAPICore]()

## [Introduction](#Introduction)

This SDK provides core features for authentication and access for various Mappls's SDKs in a very simple way.
The preferred way of integrating the SDK can be found in the  below.

## [Authentication](#Authentication)

To initialize and authenticate any **Mappls's SDK**, it is required to set keys (provided by Mappls) in `MapplsAPICore` through `MapplsAccountManager` or `Info.plist`.

Mappls's Keys can be get from [here](http://about.mappls.com/api/signup) which is governed by the API [terms and conditions](https://about.mappls.com/api/terms-&-conditions).

### [MapplsAccountManager](#MapplsAccountManager)

You can set required keys using class `MapplsAccountManager`.

 -  To access `MapplsAccountManager` addition to import statement for `MapplsAPICore` is required.

      Objective C
      ```objectivec
      #import <MapplsAPICore/MapplsAPICore.h>
      ```

      Swift
      ```swift
      import MapplsAPICore
      ```

-   Use below methods of `MapplsAccountManager` to set different keys as follows.

    Objective C
    ```objectivec
    [MapplsAccountManager setMapSDKKey:@"MAP_SDK_KEY"];
    [MapplsAccountManager setRestAPIKey:@"REST_API_KEY"];
    [MapplsAccountManager setClientId:@"CLIENT_ID"];
    [MapplsAccountManager setClientSecret:@"CLIENT_SECRET"];
    [MapplsAccountManager setGrantType:@"client_credentials"]; //optional
    ```
    Swift
    ```swift
    MapplsAccountManager.setMapSDKKey("MAP_SDK_KEY")
    MapplsAccountManager.setRestAPIKey("REST_API_KEY")
    MapplsAccountManager.setClientId("CLIENT_ID")
    MapplsAccountManager.setClientSecret("CLIENT_SECRET")
    MapplsAccountManager.setGrantType("client_credentials") //optional
    ```
  _Note: Add the above to your's application's initialization i.e `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of AppDelegate_

### [Info Plist](#Info-Plist)

    You can set required Mappls's keys by application's `Info.plist`.

    To set different Mappls's keys add different keys in `Info.plist` and set value against each key.

    Below are different keys which can be added in `Info.plist`.

    -   `MapplsSDKKey`
    -   `MapplsRestKey`
    -   `MapplsClientId`
    -   `MapplsClientSecret`
    -   `MapplsGrantType`
