# Setting Regions - Limiting Geographic Area

Source data can often contain more information than what's needed in your map.
For example, an administrative places dataset may contain data for a country OR set of countries OR contain places for the entire world; when you may only need political boundaries for North America or the USA.
In this scenario, you can specify a region in SDK to limit the geographic extent of the data that will be tiled.

As of now, **the tiles for global maps are enabled by default** for all users as a means for users to visually experience our international maps.

Search and Routing APIs are available for the entire world as well; but they are enabled by default for India only for all customers.
If any customer wishes to use our Search and Routing Stacks of SDKs & APIs in their apps, please contact our API Support team.

Why limit access?

By reducing the amount of data querying & transference required, you can reduce your API transaction costs and also reduce the amount of time it takes for your job to process.

Now what you as a developer need to do is to specify a region in our APIs/SDKs from the list of globally applicable region values and that's it !!
[See Country List](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-rest-api/blob/master/docs/countryISO.md)

To specify the region , refer to the below code. Default is India ("IND")

```js
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setDefaultRegion(MMIRegionTypeIdentifier("IND"))
```
or

```js
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setDefaultRegion(MMIRegionTypeIdentifier("KWT"))
```

To select from a country list, use below code **(Available from MapmyIndiaAPIKit Version 1.4.19)**. Default is (.india)

```js
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setDefaultRegion(.kuwait)
```
