The create geofence method helps you to create a geofence under your account. Three types of geofence can be created: Point, Circle, Polygon.

#### Point Geofence

Input the Lat, long, and the name of the geofence to create the point geofence. A point geofence has a fixed radius of 100 meters, so the user need not put the radius of the geofence. To customize the radius of geofence refers to the circle geofence method.

### objective-c
```objc
// Point type geofence
//IntouchGeometryPoint - it accepts point coordinate.
//IntouchPointGeofence - it accepts geometry coordinate and name.
//IntouchGeofenceOptions - class it accepts object of geofence 

CLLocation*referenceLocation = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:28.550667 longitude:77.268959];
IntouchGeometryPoint*point = [[IntouchGeometryPoint alloc]initWithPoint:referenceLocation];    IntouchPointGeofence*point1 = [[IntouchPointGeofence alloc]initWithName:@"test" geometry:point];
self.geofenceOptions = [[IntouchGeofenceOptions alloc]initWithGeofence:point1];
   [Intouch.shared createGeoFenceWithGeofence:_geofenceOptions completionHandler:^(NSInteger status, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if(error) {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    } else {
        // write your code here.
    }
}];
```

### Swift
```swift
let geometry = IntouchGeometryPoint(point: CLLocation(latitude: 23.343, longitude: 77.232))
                let geofence2 = IntouchPointGeofence(name: "Test", geometry: geometry)
                let geofenceoption = IntouchGeofenceOptions(geofence: geofence2)
                Intouch.shared.createGeoFence(geofence: geofenceoption) { (status, error) in
    if let error = error {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    }
    if let result = status {
        // write your code here.
    }
}
```

#### Circle Geofence

Create a circle geofence with a radius of your choice. Input Lat, long, Radius, and name of the geofence to create the circle geofence.

### objective-c
```objc 
// Circle type geofence, the radius will be in meters.
// Status - returns success if geofence created else error as callback methods.
// IntouchPointGeofence - it will accepts geometry, name and circle radius.

NSNumber *myDoubleNumber = [NSNumber numberWithDouble:500];
    IntouchPointGeofence*withBuffer = [[IntouchPointGeofence alloc]initWithName:@"Test" buffer:myDoubleNumber geometry:point];

IntouchGeofenceOptions*geofenceOptionsWithRadius = [[IntouchGeofenceOptions alloc]initWithGeofence:withBuffer];
    
[Intouch.shared createGeoFenceWithGeofence:_geofenceOptionsWithRadius completionHandler:^(NSInteger status, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if(error) {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    } else {
        // write your code here.  
    }
}];
 ```

### Swift
```swift 
let geometry = IntouchGeometryPoint(point: CLLocation(latitude: 23.343, longitude: 77.232))
                let geofence2 = IntouchPointGeofence(name: "Test", buffer: 500, geometry:
                    geometry)

let geofenceoption = IntouchGeofenceOptions(geofence: geofence2)

Intouch.shared.createGeoFence(geofence: geofenceoption) { (status, error) in
    if let error = error {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    }
    if let result = status {
        // write your code here.
    }
}
 ```

## 6) Trips

Trips module helps you to create a Trip and assign it to the vehicle and the trip compliance. InTouch provides the three major functionalities of Trips modules.

Trip Module Features -

1.  Start a trip with or without destination and via points or with scheduled end time,
2.  Get the latest trip information. ( Total traveled distance during the trip, Travelled path vs planned route, ETA to the destination, etc.)
3.  Trip completion.
	-   Trips can be completed/closed in three different ways.
		-   Based on the scheduled end time
		-   On reaching the destination.
		-   Manually close.

When the trip is created with a destination, InTouch will provide the actual time of the destination and waypoints. 

#### 6.1) Create Trip

InTouch provides four ways to create a new trip. Depending on the use case, You can use the below methods to start a new trip. Based on the selected trip creation method, either trip gets closed/completed automatically or by calling the manual method.

-   Trips without a destination
-   Trips with scheduled end time but without a destination
-   Trips with destination and scheduled end time.
-   Trips with destination but without a scheduled end time.

#### 1. 1. 1 Create Trip without a destination
This method can be used to share a live location with someone else. In this case, the trip shall be closed by calling the close trip method (6.4). 

Also, if the force close is enabled then on the new trip assignment, the active old trip will be force closed. 
### Objective-c
```Objective-c
//IntouchCreateTripResponse - Returned trip ID else return error
NSDictionary*metaData = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"test",@"alpha",nil];

IntouchCreateTripOptions*createTripOptions = [[IntouchCreateTripOptions alloc]initWithDeviceId:232 name:@"" forceClose:NO metaData:_metaData];
    
[Intouch.shared createTripDataWithOptons:_createTripOptions completionHandler:^(IntouchCreateTripResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if(error) {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    } else {
        // write your code here.  
    }
}];
```

### Swift
```swift
let metaData: [String: String] = [
                    "alpha": "test",
                ]

let options = IntouchCreateTripOptions(name:"",deviceId: 67790, forceClose: true, metaData: metaData)

Intouch.shared.createTripData(optons: options) { (status, error) in
    if let error = error {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    }
    if let result = response {
        // write your code here.  
    }      
}
```

#### 6.1.2)  Create Trip with Destination and Geofences. 

This method helps to create trips with a destination and waypoints.  Here trip will get close only if the vehicle reaches the destination. otherwise, the manual close trip option can be used to close the trip. 

Also if the force close is enabled then on the new trip assignment, the active old trip will be force closed. 

### Objective-c
```obj

NSDictionary*metaData = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"test",@"alpha",nil];

IntouchGeometryPoint*tripGeoemetry =  [[IntouchGeometryPoint alloc]initWithPoint:referenceLocation];

IntouchTripDestination*tripDestination =[[IntouchTripDestination alloc]initWithGeoemtry:tripGeoemetry radius:500 scheduledAt:0 metadata:_metaData];

IntouchTripsGeofences*tripGeofence =[[IntouchTripsGeofences alloc]initWithGeoemtry:tripGeoemetry radius:500 scheduledAt:0 metadata:_metaData];
     
IntouchTripsGeofences*tripGeofence1 =[[IntouchTripsGeofences alloc]initWithGeoemtry:tripGeoemetry radius:500 scheduledAt:0 metadata:_metaData];

NSArray*arrGeofence = [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjects:tripGeofence,tripGeofence1, nil];

IntouchCreateTripOptions*createTripOptionsWithGeofence = [[IntouchCreateTripOptions alloc]initWithGeofences:arrGeofence tripDestination:tripDestination name:@"" deviceId:324 forceClose:false metaData:_metaData];

[Intouch.shared createTripDataWithOptons:_createTripOptionsWithGeofence completionHandler:^(IntouchCreateTripResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if(error) {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    } else {
        // write your code here.  
    }
}];
```

### Swift
```swift
let metaData: [String: String] = [
                    "alpha": "test",
                ]
                
let optiongeo = IntouchGeometryPoint(point: CLLocation(latitude: 23.343, longitude: 77.232))
                
let tripdestination = IntouchTripDestination(geoemtry: optiongeo, radius: 500, scheduledAt: 0, metadata: metaData)
                
let tripGeofence = IntouchTripsGeofences(geoemtry: optiongeo, radius: 500, scheduledAt: 0,metadata: metaData)
                
let options = IntouchCreateTripOptions(geofences: [tripGeofence], tripDestination: tripdestination,name:"" deviceId: 67790, forceClose: true, metaData: metaData)

Intouch.shared.createTripData(optons: options) { (response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    }
    if let result = response {
        // write your code here.  
    }      
}
```

#### 6.1.3)  Create Trip with Destination and Geofences using scheduled end time. 

In this method, the trip will get close to the scheduled end time. It is based on the trip duration. Irrespective of the vehicle arrival status on the geofence, the trip will get close after the trip duration (Scheduled end time).  Otherwise, the manual close trip option can be used. 

Also, if the force close is enabled then on the new trip assignment , active old trip will be force closed. 

### Objective-c
```objc
IntouchGeometryPoint*tripGeoemetry =  [[IntouchGeometryPoint alloc]initWithPoint:referenceLocation];

IntouchTripDestination*tripDestination =[[IntouchTripDestination alloc]initWithGeoemtry:tripGeoemetry radius:500 scheduledAt:0 metadata:_metaData];

IntouchTripsGeofences*tripGeofence =[[IntouchTripsGeofences alloc]initWithGeoemtry:tripGeoemetry radius:500 scheduledAt:0 metadata:_metaData];

IntouchTripsGeofences*tripGeofence1 =[[IntouchTripsGeofences alloc]initWithGeoemtry:tripGeoemetry radius:500 scheduledAt:0 metadata:_metaData];

NSArray*arrGeofence = [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjects:tripGeofence,tripGeofence1, nil];

IntouchCreateTripOptions*createTripOptionsWithSeheduleTimeAndGeometry = [[IntouchCreateTripOptions alloc]initWithGeofence:arrGeofence tripDestination:tripDestination name:@"" deviceId:324 forceClose:false scheduledEndTime:1111222 metaData:_metaData];

[Intouch.shared createTripDataWithOptons:_createTripOptionsWithSeheduleTimeAndGeometry completionHandler:^(IntouchCreateTripResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if(error) {
        // reason gives the error type. 
        // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
        // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.  
    } else {
        // write your code here.  
    }
}];            
```
